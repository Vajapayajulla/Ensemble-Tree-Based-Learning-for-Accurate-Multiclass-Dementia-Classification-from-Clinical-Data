# 🧠 Ensemble Tree-Based Learning for Accurate Multiclass Dementia Classification from Clinical Data

This project applies advanced **ensemble tree-based machine learning algorithms** to accurately classify dementia stages (Nondemented, Demented, Converted) using structured clinical data from the **OASIS longitudinal dataset**.

## 📌 Overview

Dementia is a progressive neurological disorder, and early diagnosis is critical. We propose a classification system using **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, and **LightGBM** to predict dementia stages from features like MMSE, CDR, brain volume, age, and education level.

We also use **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** to interpret the contribution of each clinical feature to the model's predictions, ensuring transparency in healthcare-related AI decisions.

## 🗂️ Dataset

- **Source**: [OASIS Longitudinal Dataset](https://www.oasis-brains.org/)
- **Samples**: ~373 patient records (augmented as needed)
- **Key Features**:
  - Age
  - MMSE (Mini-Mental State Exam)
  - CDR (Clinical Dementia Rating)
  - MR Delay
  - eTIV (Estimated Total Intracranial Volume)
  - nWBV (Normalized Whole Brain Volume)
  - SES (Socioeconomic Status)
  - Educ (Years of Education)
  - Gender, Visit

- **Target Variable**:  
  - 0 = Nondemented  
  - 1 = Demented  
  - 2 = Converted

---

## ✅ Models Used

- 📊 **Random Forest**
- ⚡ **XGBoost**
- 🌿 **LightGBM**

All models were trained using **Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation** for balanced performance evaluation.

## 🔍 Explainability with SHAP

To ensure interpretability of the predictions:
- SHAP summary plots were generated.
- CDR, MMSE, MR Delay, and Age were found to be the most influential features.

## 🏆 Results

| Model       | Accuracy |
|-------------|----------|
| Random Forest | 88.57% |
| XGBoost       | 91.42% ✅ |
| LightGBM      | 90.00% |

- XGBoost performed best with highest accuracy and generalization.
- Confusion matrix and classification reports were used for detailed evaluation.
